It's a minigame that is based on Survival Games, but a few chenges, which are inspired by the game PUBG, should improve this minigame.

The Start:
The players spawn in an aircraft and have to leave this within 30 seconds and use the elytra to fly to the ground.

The Loot:
You don't get items by opening chest, because they are distributed on the ground. 
The items are hold by invisible Armorstands or these armorstands wear armor parts.
With a rightclick on these items you will get them.
Items will only spawn in houses. That means within villages, towns or military areas.
The quality of the loot will be better in military areas, than in towns or villages.

The Items:
- Armor 
- Swords and axes
- Bow and arrows
- Food
- Equipment to enchant
There will be no blocks available.
Various weapons can also be implemented, they could be based on the game "Zombies" on Hypixel

The Map:
The map is an island that includes the following:
- 4 villages: little farms
- 2 towns: Houses with up to 4 floors and special buildings (school, church, etc.)
- 2 military areas: Military structures like airport, barracks, etc.
In addition to the mentioned areas, there will be open fields and forests that include some houses. Furthermore there are roads / paths that connect the villages.
You can build maps with different map themes, e.g. civil war, pirates or western.

The Zones:
There will be different zones, that accidentally spawn on the map and stay for about 30 seconds.
- Bomb-Zone: TNT is falling from the sky and explodes on when it touches the ground
- Zombie-Zone: There are different zombies spawning
- Toxic-Zone:A poisonous rain comes up, you get damage under the open sky

The Border:
After 3 minutes the border starts to get smaller. The middle of the Border is located at x=0,z=0.
Therefor there is no deathmatch, as the players are pushed towards each other.
